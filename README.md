* [step-4](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-4) = added enough code to get first scenario to pass

* [step-5](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-5) = added basic scenario to show that you can 'view' any generic website

* [step-6](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-6) = updated previous scenario to take google.com regional redirects into account

* [step-7](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-7) = added a check that devclub website doesn't have any errors :P

* [step-12](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-12) = brought back the original scenario (failing)

* [step-13](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-13) = added implementation to get new scenario passing

* [step-14](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-14) = tweaked code to display results via AJAX

* [step-15](https://github.com/Inori/devclub-bdd-php/commit/step-15) = Integrate with selenium to test application with javascript (AJAX) calls
		    NB! Added selenium binary into repository, don't recommend this in real project
